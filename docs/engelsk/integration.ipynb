    "# Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications of integration in chemistry. Integration is used for everything from calculating molecular geometry in quantum chemistry to calculating the area of a peak in an NMR spectrum or a chromatogram to find the concentration of analytes. In addition, we need to integrate to solve differential equations, which are really important in physical chemistry and quantum chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the integral, really?\n",
    "Historically, integration is a way of calculating areas and volumes. Today, we use integrals for a lot of different things, but in many cases, it is useful to think of the integral as a sum of small pieces. The integral sign ∫ is in fact an elongated _S_, which means sum. In ancient Greek, over 1500 years before calculus was invented by Newton and Leibniz, the greek mathematicians calculated areas of geometric figures by partitioning them into smaller areas, often rectangles, and summing up the areas of all the smaller areas. This was an inefficient way of computing areas and volumes, since we need a lot of small areas to get a good approximation. Then came calculus, the study of infinitesimals and continous change.\n",
    "\n",
    "With calculus (about 1700) came rigorous mathematical theorems and integration rules which you have learned to use in high school. This lets us compute integrals quickly (sometimes!) and exact. We call this analytical integration. Perhaps the most powerful result in calculus is the _fundamental theorem of calculus_ (sounds important, right?!). This states that integration is the reverse of differentiating (taking the derivative):\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Fundamental theorem of calculus\n",
    "Let _f_ be a continous function in the interval [a,b], and _F_ be a function defined for _x_ in [a,b]. That is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F'(x) = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, this means that the integral of a function is equal to the antiderivative to the function.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus is a very important tool, but there are especially two caveats to using a set of rules to compute integrals:\n",
    "-\tNot all integrals can be solved analytically.\n",
    "-\tWhen using rules, you might forget what you are actually doing, that is, what the integral really means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you sometimes feel that you get in a \"plug-and-chug\" mode, where you apply integration rules and do a lot of algebra, get the right result, but do not really understand what is going on? You are not alone. When the ancient greeks used sums of small parts, they used what we now know as the definition of the integral to approximate areas and volumes. They couldn't have forgot what the integral meant in the process, since they worked with the very definition of it. Couldn't we use the same technique today? Yes, of course. But wasn't it quite tedious to do all these calculations? Well, now we have another tool at our disposal: the computer. Summing thousands of areas is now done in a fraction of a second, greatly outperforming the ancient greeks. So let us get into the mindset of an ancient g(r)eek and start integrating!\n",

    "## Rectangle methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at how we can approximate an integral as a sum of geometric figures, like the ancient greeks did.  The simplest way of doing this, is by using rectangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/andreasdh/programmering-i-kjemi/blob/master/docs/bilder/rektangel10_utentall.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use $N = 10$ rectangles to approximate the integral $f(x) = \\cos{(x)} + 2$ for $x\\in[2,12]$. The width of all rectangles is then $(b-a)/N = (12-2)/10 = 1$. We can also see that the height of each rectangle is $f(x_n)$, with $n\\in[2,11]$, that is, we only let the left side of the rectangle reach the function graph. If we calculate the sum of the areas of every rectangle, we get _A_ = 18.046675645664006. This is a crude approximation to the analytical value ($(\\sin{(12)} + 2\\cdot 12)-(\\sin{(2)} + 2\\cdot 2) \\approx 18.554129655173885$. But if we increase the number of rectangles, for example to 50, we get a better approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/andreasdh/programmering-i-kjemi/blob/master/docs/bilder/rektangel_n=50.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious, especially in the first figure, that several areas of the rectangles lie outside the graph. They are both too far above and below the graph in several places. But the error is not as big as it might seem because we just have areas both above and below the graph. The relative error here is approx. 2.7 \\% with 10 rectangles and 0.65 \\% with 50 rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate the error with a linear function $f(x) = 10x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/andreasdh/programmering-i-kjemi/blob/master/docs/bilder/rektangel_venstre_n=10.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In these models, we have measured the rectangle height on the left outer edge of the rectangle. In this instance, this gives us an underestimation of the exact area for each rectangle. We can also measure the height of the rectangles on the right edge. We then get a corresponding overestimation with this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/andreasdh/programmering-i-kjemi/blob/master/docs/bilder/rektangel_h%C3%B8yre_n=10.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see here that we get a large underestimation with the left edge approximation and a large overestimation with the right edge approximation, with a relative error of approx. 7.1 \\%. The same happens for all functions in intervals that are either increasing or decreasing throughout the whole interval. One way to compensate for this is to use the height of the rectangles in the middle instead of the end point on the left or right:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/andreasdh/programmering-i-kjemi/blob/master/docs/bilder/rektangel_midt_n=10.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approximation is therefore attained with the _midpoint method_. For linear functions, we will actually get an exact value (even with one rectangle!) because the error of the rectangles are the same size above and below the function. But the midpoint approximation gives a better result with other functions as well. Methods like these were used by both ancient Greeks and ancient Babylonians, but they did not have a computer at their disposal! So, let's now look at how we can implement these methods in Python."
